# HAI Bot User Journeys

This document outlines key user journeys within the HAI Bot ecosystem, highlighting how users interact with the platform and where Hedera technology is integrated into the experience.

## Current Discovery & Onboarding

### User Discovery Channels
- **Twitter Presence**: Primary discovery channel through tweets and demonstrations
- **Twitter Bio Link**: Direct link to HAI Bot in bio
- **Community Interviews**: Appearances on AXL live streams with community members
- **Word of Mouth**: Existing users sharing experiences with peers

### User Motivations
- Creating memes for NFT communities
- Digital art creation
- Film and graphic design projects
- Accessing multiple AI models through a single interface

## Journey 1: New User Onboarding

### Step 1: Discovery & Initial Engagement
- User discovers HAI Bot through Twitter demos or community recommendations
- User joins the Discord server or sends a direct message to HAI Bot
- User starts exploring free commands to understand capabilities

### Step 2: Credit System Introduction
- User learns about the credit-based system for premium features
- User issues the `/deposit credit` command
- User sees options to deposit HBAR or HAI tokens

### Step 3: Credit Acquisition
- User selects preferred token (HBAR or HAI)
- System provides a Hedera account ID and unique memo for the transaction
- User sends funds to the treasury account with their unique memo
- Credits become available in the specific server or DM where deposit was initiated
- **Future Hedera Integration**: Transaction will be recorded on Hedera Consensus Service with HCS-SQL implementation

### Step 4: Premium Feature Usage
- User accesses premium AI models using the acquired credits
- User generates content with advanced capabilities
- System deducts credits based on the specific AI model and operation
- **Future Hedera Integration**: Credit deductions will be recorded on HCS

## Journey 2: Power User Experience (Law's Workflow)

### Step 1: Brainstorming Phase
- Experienced user logs into Discord 
- User leverages HAI Bot as a brainstorming and concept development studio
- User generates initial ideas using text-based AI models

### Step 2: Low-Level Asset Creation
- User creates concept art using image generation commands
- User refines designs through iterative prompts
- User experiments with various AI models for different aesthetic styles

### Step 3: Prototype Development
- User generates multiple assets for a project (e.g., for video game development)
- User combines various media types (images, 3D models, music)
- User moves generated assets to production tools for refinement

### Step 4: Credit Management
- User checks credit balance using credit dashboard command
- Dashboard displays transaction statistics:
  - All-time transactions (currently 10,068 transactions)
  - Token usage breakdown
  - Project profit information (20% used for HAI token burns)
- User deposits additional credits as needed

## Journey 3: Community Server Integration

### Step 1: Server Discovery
- Community admin discovers HAI Bot through Twitter or word of mouth
- Admin invites HAI Bot to their Discord server

### Step 2: Server Credits
- Admin or community members deposit credits in the server
- These credits become available to all server members
- **Important**: Credits are tied to the location where they are deposited (server-specific)

### Step 3: Community Usage
- Server members interact with HAI Bot for various creative purposes
- Members create content for the community (memes, artwork, etc.)
- Credits are consumed from the server's pooled balance

### Step 4: Admin Analytics
- Admin uses the credit dashboard command to view usage statistics
- Dashboard shows:
  - All-time token statistics
  - Current month statistics
  - Token usage breakdown
  - Project profits

## Journey 4: Web Application (Future - Within 6 Months)

### Step 1: Expanded Interface
- User accesses the web version of HAI Bot
- All Discord features available in web interface
- User logs in with existing credentials

### Step 2: Node-Based Workflow
- User leverages new node-based interface exclusive to web version
- User creates complex workflows connecting multiple AI models
- User enables different functions to interact with each other in a flowchart style

### Step 3: Advanced Asset Creation
- User creates more nuanced content through interconnected nodes
- User develops deeper and more sophisticated assets
- User saves workflows for future use

### Step 4: Cross-Platform Synchronization
- Credits and usage history synchronized between Discord and web
- User seamlessly transitions between platforms
- **Future Hedera Integration**: All transactions backed up via HCS-SQL

## Analytics Benefits (Future HCS Integration)

### Enhanced User Experience
- Users discover trending AI models that perform well for specific tasks
- System recommends models based on community popularity
- Better resource allocation based on actual usage patterns
- **Privacy Protection**: All analytics collected without recording actual prompt content

### Server Admin Insights
- Server admins receive anonymized analytics about model usage
- Admins can allocate credits to popular model types
- Usage trend visualization helps in community planning
- Improved understanding of which models deliver the best results

### Platform Improvements
- Development team uses analytics to prioritize integration of new models
- System performance optimized based on real usage patterns
- Credit costs adjusted to reflect actual model usage and value
- Better load balancing based on peak usage times

## Real-World Use Cases

### NFT Community Support
- Users create memes and promotional materials for NFT communities
- Fresh content generation drives community engagement
- Simplified access to multiple AI tools speeds up content creation

### Game Development
- Team is currently developing a full-featured AA-level video game
- All assets created using HAI Bot
- Demonstrates the production-quality capabilities of the platform

### Content Creator Workflow
- Digital artists use HAI Bot for initial concept development
- Musicians generate ideas and basic compositions
- Filmmakers create storyboards and visual concepts
- All creators benefit from single credit system across multiple AI models

## Support System

- System performance metrics for continuous improvement

## Impact of Marketing Grant on User Journeys

The HBAR Foundation grant will enhance these user journeys through:

1. **Expanded Discovery**: More targeted Twitter campaigns and influencer collaborations will introduce HAI Bot to wider audiences
2. **Smoother Onboarding**: Demo credits will allow new users to experience premium features immediately
3. **Community Growth**: Integration with more servers will create diverse use cases
4. **Platform Expansion**: Accelerated development of web interface with node-based system
5. **Transaction Volume**: All of the above will drive increased transaction volume on the Hedera network, especially once HCS-SQL is implemented
